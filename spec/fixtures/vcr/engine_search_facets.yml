        meters (128,100 feet) in a helium-filled balloon, Felix Baumgartner completed
        a record breaking jump for the ages from the edge of space, exactly 65 years
        after Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier flying in an experimental
        rocket-powered airplane. Felix reached a maximum of speed of 1,357.6 km/h
        or 843.6 mph(Mach 1.25) through the near vacuum of the stratosphere before
        being slowed by the atmosphere later during his 4:20 minute long freefall.
        The 43-year-old Austrian skydiving expert also broke two other world records
        (highest freefall, highest manned balloon flight), leaving the one for the
        longest freefall to project mentor Col. Joe Kittinger.\n\nWatch the Full Recap:
